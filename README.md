## General Info
***
Write down general information about your project. It is a good idea to always put a project status in the readme file. This is where you can add it. 
This project consists of creating a LKM in a Raspberry Pi with a Debian based OS. The LKM controlls the interrupt events generated through 4 buttons connected to the Raspberry PI GPIO's. Each time a button is pressed, a Bash script is executed and the state of the LEDs connected to the RaspberryPI are modified.
